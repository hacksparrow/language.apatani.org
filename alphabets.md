**Vowel Lengths**

There are long vowels in many Apatani words. Single letters denote short vowels whereas long vowels are denoted by double letters. The following are the examples:

Short: tamì (weed), peca (wild pear)
Long : saati (pine sap), peenw (procession)

**Tones**

Apatani is a tonal language. The tone associated with a word makes all the difference in giving a meaning to a word. The three main tones are rising, level and falling. The rising tone is denoted by a rising diacritic on the concerned vowel and falling tone with a falling diacritic. The level tone is left unmarked. Examples are:

Rising tone: aló (bone)
Level tone: alo (day)
Falling tone: alò (to dry)

**Consonant Lengths**

There are words with short and long consonants as well in Apatani. They are also denoted by single and double letters for short and long respectively.
